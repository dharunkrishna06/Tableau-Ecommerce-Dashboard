# 🛒 E-Commerce Product & Review Dashboard – Tableau Project

This interactive dashboard was built as part of a business case assignment to demonstrate analytical thinking, dashboard design, and business storytelling — using real-world e-commerce data.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a unified view of **product pricing**, **discounting behavior**, **customer sentiment**, and **reviewer activity** — helping business teams make faster, data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Key Business Questions Answered

- How are our products priced, before and after discounts?
- Which categories contribute most to total discounts?
- What are customers saying — and what’s the overall sentiment?
- Which products are bestsellers by category?
- Who are the top reviewers, and what kind of feedback do they provide?

---

## 🧠 Thought Process

Before building, I stepped back and asked:  
> “If I were on the business team, what would I actually want to know from this data?”

That led to:
- Organizing the product hierarchy (Category → Sub-category → Product)
- Creating **price bands** to analyze pre- and post-discount positioning
- Layering in **customer review sentiment**
- Highlighting **top reviewers** to add reviewer credibility context
